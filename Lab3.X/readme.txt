This is a snake game to be played on a Pic32 (PIC32MX795F512L) microcontroller based board (ChipKIT Pro MX7). The interface is through a 4-axis joystick, oled display, and on-board buttons. The main.c file contains the game's logic and device interfaces. The program follows a state machine design and uses hardware interrupts for joystick motion and button clicking. All source code was designed and written by Karthik Ramesh
